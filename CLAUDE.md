# CLAUDE.md - Project Documentation Guide

## Planning and Research Mode

When working in planning and research mode, all documentation should be:
- **Read from**: The `docs/` folder
- **Written to**: The `docs/` folder

This ensures all planning documents, research notes, and design documentation are organized in a centralized location.

### Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── planning/     # Strategic planning documents
├── research/     # Research findings and analysis
├── design/       # Design documents and specifications
└── notes/        # General notes and ideas
```

Feel free to create subdirectories within `docs/` as needed to organize different types of planning and research materials.

## Code Writing Restrictions

**IMPORTANT**: Code should ONLY be written when operating in "coding" mode. 

When in planning or research mode:
- Do NOT write any implementation code
- Focus on design, architecture, and documentation
- Create specifications and technical plans instead of code
- Use pseudocode or high-level descriptions when illustrating concepts
